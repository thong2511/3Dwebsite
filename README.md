# 3DWebsite
3D website/portfolio

# Description 
This project is meant to help people create a creative website/portfolio with 3D animated avatar of yourself! This project was created using Three.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Blender. Specifically the 3D avatar was created using Blender to combine the avatar and its animation.

# General steps/overview to create 3D avatar
1. Go to avaturn at https://avaturn.me/ and then create your avatar and then download it under .glb, remember to also download it under .fbx so it could be upload to mixamo!
2. From there go to Mixamo at https://www.mixamo.com/#/  and find the animation you like.
3. In Mixamo upload the file to the animation you chose, the file should looks something like: "mesh_for_mixamo....fbx".
4. If you wanted to use multiple animation like me then go ahead and pick another animation in step 2 and upload the file again like step 3. If you only want one animation just go ahead and skip this 4th step!
5. Now you combine those above in blender app at https://www.blender.org/ .
6. Play around with blender and the animation and use the link to the website of Blender for guidance!

# Incorporate the avatar and the website 
Congratulations on having your 3D avatar up and running, now it is the time for you to incorporate it into your personal website. You could clone my repository for reference! 

# Future Improvements
This is the first implementation of this project and just like anyone else I am just on the tip of the iceberg of graphic designing and Three.js's knowledge but still there are room for improvements and here are some example:
1. Incorporating even more animations to the avatar
    - As you can see the above work has only incorporate 2 animations and we can definitely go above and beyond
    - We can try out various ways of making the avatar doing harder animations and can even create simple actions such as kicking a ball.

# Authors and Acknowledgement
This project was developed by Tom (Thong) Hoang as a personal project in CS460 - Computer Graphics course at University of Massachusetts Boston.

I would like to acknowledge the help of professor Daniel Haehn with his fascinating lectures and also my classmates and TAs in terms of debugging. I have learned how to master Three.js, Blender, and other data visualization tools. Without such help I could not create the 3DWebsite.

Last but not least, I wanted to thank the open-sources community such as Three.js for their contribution to graphic designing.
